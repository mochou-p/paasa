# paasa

this parser has strict rules, it aims to follow only what the compiler allows.  
it will most probably not produce reasonable results from nonsense input.  

this allows more fine-grained tokens, instead of general ambiguous ones,  
which can be helpful when implementing realistic syntax highlighting,  
or other features in a text editor.
